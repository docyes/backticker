# Back Ticker

setInterval's older brother. A Backbone-like class for creating objects that emit a tick event (Backbone.Events Mixin) at a defined interval based on an internal timer.

```js
var ticker = new Ticker({interval: 500, start: true});
ticker.on('tick', function() {
  console.log('tick');
});
```

## constructor / initialize
### new Backbone.Ticker([options])

If {interval: number} is passed as an option sets the `tick` `interval` rate otherwise defaults to every 0 ms.

If {start: true} is passed as an option starts the ticker otherwise it must manually be started before emmiting `tick` events.

If {params: value(s)} is passed as an option when the `tick` event is trigggered it will pass the value as a subsequent argument. Note, if value is an array it will pass each item as a subsequent argument.

## start([tick])

If `tick` is true will emit a `tick` event immediately.

## stop()

Stop the current internal timer and any subsequent `tick` events from firing.

## restart([options])

Restart the current timer.

If {interval: number} is passed as an option sets the tick `interval` rate otherwise defaults to interval from constructor.

If {tick: true} is passed as an option will emit a `tick` event immediately.

If {params: value} is passed as an option when the `tick` event is trigggered it will pass the value as a subsequent argument. Note, if value is an array it will pass each item as a subsequent argument.

## tick([params])

Emit a `tick` event.

If `param` the `tick` event will pass the value as a subsequent argument. Note, if the valie is an array it will pass each item as a subsequent argument.

## cid
A special property of tickers, the `cid` or client id is a unique identifier automatically assigned to all tickers when they're first created.

## interval
The `interval` between each `tick` event; defaults to undefined.

## params
When the `tick` event is trigggered params will be passed as a subsequent argument; defaults to undefined.

## Catalog of Events
"tick" â€” when the elapsed time is equal to the set `interval`

## Backbone.Events Mixin
BackTicker uses the **Backbone.Events Mixin**; a module that can be mixed in to any object, giving the object the ability to bind and `trigger` custom named events. 
See http://backbonejs.org/#Events for full documentation.
